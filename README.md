Features:

Big Board along with scout rankings of all prospects in 2025 NBA Draft

User can navigate from Big Board to player cards. The user can access an individual player card by clicking on the player name in the big board. 
Inside the player card, the user can see the cards so far representing available photo,
height, weight, and hometown. Along with this information, the user can see the mavericks scout rankings
and submit scouting reports, with the user being able to see what they typed when they click submit. 

When the user clicks on the player profile, they are able to see the player's true measurements and 
statistics through game logs or in season stats. They are also able to filter which season the player has those game logs 
(there isn't enough game logs for more than one season but it's a nice feature for future purposes) and they have the ability
to sort through stats in the game logs by most to least.
